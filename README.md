> [🎥 Watch the speed run video!](https://youtu.be/zgj8ZT4-9lk)



# 🏃‍♀️ Quick Start
Required: [Node](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

```
git clone https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth.git matic-nft-tutorial
```
```
cd matic-nft-tutorial
```
```
yarn install
```

First, be sure to check that you're deploying on `mumbai` by changing the `defaultNetwork` in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.js`:

🔐 We will need to generate a **deployer** account:

```
yarn generate
```

🙎 This will create a new mnemonic and you can get this **deployer** address using the command:

```
yarn account
```

Go to https://faucet.matic.network to get some Mumbai-MATIC (testnet currency).

Confirm that your account has the funds needed for the rest of the tutorial: (check on https://mumbai.polygonscan.com)

> Compile and deploy your NFT contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

To point the frontend at `mumbai` we will also need to edit `targetNetwork` in `packages/react-app/src/App.jsx`:

Start the frontend with:

```
yarn start
```

📱 Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app

---

### Minting:

> ✏️ Edit the mint script mint.js in packages/hardhat/scripts and update the `toAddress` to your frontend address (wallet address in the top right or localhost:3000).

> in a new terminal window run the mint script:
```
cd matic-nft-tutorial
yarn mint
```

👀 You should see your collectibles show up on the frontend if you minted to the correct address:

👛 Open an **incognito** window and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (You'll notice it has a new wallet address).

🎟 Send an NFT to the incognito window address:

🕵🏻‍♂️ Inspect the `Debug Contracts` tab to figure out what address is the `owner` of `YourCollectible`?

💼 Edit your deployment script `deploy.js` in `packages/hardhat/scripts`

🔏 Edit your smart contract `YourCollectible.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`

📝 Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`

⬇️ Installing a new package to your frontend? You need to `cd packages/react-app` and then `yarn add PACKAGE`

# FAQs

What happens if I run into a chainID error?
		Under `packages/hardhat/deployments`, make sure that your chainID for your desired chain to deploy to is correct. The chainID file is located under their respective chain folders. For Matic, the correct chainID is 134. For Mumbai, the correct chainID is 80001.

What happens if I run into a gas error?
		This can be caused by many things. First check if you do have enough gas to deploy on your various networks. Then, try to raise the `gasPrice` as shown below under `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.js`.
